# Countryside Mapper

### Application

The app is build using ReactJS and Typescript, along with a Firebase database in
the backend. You can view a live version
at [https://countrysidemapper.aniketg.me/](https://countrysidemapper.aniketg.me/).

This project was made for the international
hackathon, [Garuda Hacks](https://garudahacks.com/). I participated in a group
of four, and we placed runner-up in the hackathon.

### Our Mission!

Welcome to Countryside Mapper! Our mission is to provide tourists with unique
visiting spots. In particular, we focus on the rural areas of Indonesia with
agriculture. Some commodities include palm oil, natural rubber, cocoa, coffee,
tea, cassava, rice, and tropical spices. Feel free to explore this world and
plan your next vacation spot. Remember, you are also helping the local economy
by planning these visits. What our app does!

Combining our knowledge and research, we created an application focused on rural
development by increasing tourism. The term is agritourism: attracting members
of the public to visit agricultural operations. Our website shows various
agricultural and nature sites that tourists could visit. This could also be
incorporated by the local people. They can advertise visiting events they are
hosting by adding them to the website. During these events, locals can have
recreation, entertainment, or educational experiences for visitors. Of course,
locals are allowed and encouraged to charge tourists for their services. This
will help the local economy by creating jobs and allows for cultural exchange.
The sky is the limit for what locals can do with this. And our application is
the platform to help them reach it.
How we built it!

We decided to use what we knew in order to create something that could
potentially help. Our skill sets ranged from programming in various languages
such as react and node.js. However, we had to use some applications we didn't
know like firebase. Regardless, we were pleased to learn more.
What we learned!

Through our 48-hour experience, we learned a lot about Indonesia, its many
islands, and rural life. However, we also learned a lot about ourselves and our
skill sets. We did struggle in some places. But that just means our skills are
limited and there is so much more for us to learn. We took this as a learning
opportunity to enhance our skills. It was a great experience, and although we
are not from the area, it would be nice to visit someday.
